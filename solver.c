/*
 * Given a pointer to a maze_room, set its connections in all four directions
 *based on the hex value passed in.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * 		create_room_connections(&maze[3][4], 0xb)
 *
 * 0xb is 1011 in binary, which means we have walls on all sides except the
 *EAST. This means that every connection in maze[3][4] should be set to 1,
 *except the EAST connection, which should be set to 0.
 *
 * See the handout for more details about our hexadecimal representation, as
 *well as examples on how to use bit masks to extract information from this
 *hexadecimal representation.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *	- room: pointer to the current room
 *	- hex: hexadecimal integer (between 0-15 inclusive) that represents the
 *connections in all four directions from the given room.
 *
 * Returns:
 *	- nothing. The connections should be saved in the maze_room struct
 *pointed to by the parameter (make sure to use pointers correctly!).

/*
 * Recursive depth-first search algorithm for solving your maze.
 * This function should also print out either every visited room as it goes, or
 * the final pruned solution, depending on whether the FULL macro is set.
 *
 * Note that you may need to add extra parameters to this function's signature,
 * depending on how you choose to store the pruned solution.
 *
 * See handout for more details, as well as a pseudocode implementation.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *	- row: row of the current room
 *	- col: column of the current room
 *	- goal_row: row of the goal room
 *	- goal_col: col of the goal room
 *	- num_rows: number of rows in the maze
 *	- num_cols: number of columns in the maze
 *	- maze: a 2d array of maze_room structs representing your maze
 *	- file: the file to write the solution to
 *
 * Returns:
 *	- 1 if the current branch finds a valid solution, 0 if no branches are
 *valid.
